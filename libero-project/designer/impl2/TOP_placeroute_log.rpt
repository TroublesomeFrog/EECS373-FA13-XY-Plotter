While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates
stepper_motor_control_0/motor_output_RNIHORQ[3]:Y,
stepper_motor_control_0/motor_output_RNIGNRQ[0]:Y,
stepper_motor_control_1/motor_output_RNIK8561[3]:Y,
stepper_motor_control_1/motor_output_RNIJ7561[0]:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
